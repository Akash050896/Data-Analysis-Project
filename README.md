# Project Overview

Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis is an end-to-end Data Analytics project focused on analyzing transactional customer data to identify purchasing trends, customer segments, and revenue drivers.

The project demonstrates practical experience in data cleaning, SQL analysis, dashboard development, and business reporting using industry-standard analytics tools.


## The goal of this project is to simulate a corporate-grade end-to-end data analytics workflow, demonstrating the ability to translate raw data into strategic business intelligence by:

✅ Data Preparation,Modeling & Exploratory Data Analysis (Python): Clean and transform the raw dataset for analysis.

✅ Data Analysis (SQL): Simulate business transactions, and run queries to extract insights on customer segments, loyalty, and purchase drivers.

✅ Visualization & Insights (Power BI): Build an interactive dashboard that highlights key patterns and trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

✅ Report and Presentation: Write a clear project report summarizing your key findings and business recommendations. Prepare a presentation that visually communicates insights and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.
